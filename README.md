## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Adrienne, founder of EventBarIQ, a bar planning intelligence platform built to simplify and optimize event beverage service.

Iâ€™m here to learn, build, and collaborate. 
My background isnâ€™t in codingâ€”Iâ€™m diving into development headfirst, leveraging AI, and constantly improving my technical skills. 
My goal is to turn EventBarIQ from concept to a powerful, scalable product, and I know the best way to do that is by surrounding myself with brilliant developers who are as passionate about problem-solving as I am.
